I have always loved technology and I am also a very detail oriented person. I generally really enjoy knowing how things work, and programming happens to put those together for me.
  When I was in the university, I always wanted to divert into a programming options but because of some known limitations in the field in my home country ( e.g lack of adequate programming & coding infrastructure ), I was not able to accomplish that dream. It is totally amazing how specific you have to be when coding and am awed by it. The computer will only do what you tell it to do and I see that as a whole new way to communicate with the world. Data Science allows me to try various ideas using scientic methods. Furthermore, the data science field is an ever rapidly growing field and there are always new things to learn. This is something that I enjoy a lot as well, learning new content and sharing my knowledge with others.
